## What is ASHGallery
ASHGallery is a lightweight yet powerful web application designed to store and showcase images online effortlessly. This project serves as a hands-on implementation of the foundational concepts Iâ€™ve learned through my personal studies of **Java Spring MVC**.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack Behind ASHGallery
To bring ASHGallery to life, I utilized a robust combination of technologies:

### Front-end:
- HTML â€“ The backbone of the interface
- CSS â€“ For styling and enhancing visual appeal
- JavaServer Pages (JSP) â€“ Dynamic content rendering

### Back-end:
- Java â€“ Core programming language
- Spring MVC â€“ For structuring the application with a clean and scalable architecture

### Database:
- MySQL â€“ Efficient data storage and retrieval

ASHGallery is more than just a photo storage app - it's a testament to my journey in mastering **Java Spring MVC** and building dynamic web applications from the ground up. ðŸš€
