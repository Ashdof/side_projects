# Application Development Timeline
This describes the process I used to create the application.

### Requirements Analysis
The project began with the analysis of requirements and specifications of the system. As a web application, it will be accessed mainly on mobile phones, tablets, laptops and desktop computers. 

**Usuage Requirements**<br />
The application will require users to be authenticated anytime they want to access the platform. The user must therefore create an account with the system before proceeding with anything else.

**Typical Execution Process**<br />
For a user accessing the platform for the first time, the typical process follows the steps below:

- User accesses the main page with the platform's domain address
- User clicks on **here** link just below the login button to access the sign up page
- User provides *username, email address, password* and confirms *password*
- Login instructions are sent to the provided email address
- Using the link provided in the instructions, user accesses the platform’s **login** page
- User provides username and password to login
- If successful, user lands on the application’s **dashboard**
