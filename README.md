## Inspiration
There are numerous mobile applications available for managing personal finances. These apps have several features to enable users to conveniently keep track of their finances, including the ability to backup to the cloud. However, the convenience of the app usage is limited to only the mobile device.

**ASHPense Manager** was born out of the desire to have such a tool accessible on all devices as far as the device has a web browser. A web application boasts of several advantages which the mobile app lacks:
- No need to worry about backing up data as the platform's hosting agent caters for that.
- Platform can be accessed on any device, regardless the operating system.
- Platform can still be accessed in the event the user's device breaks down. There will be no need to reinstall and download backups
- The platform is always up-to-date; there will be no need to install updates and security patches
- Users can also switch between devices and continue using the platform without losing data or their progress.
- Users experience is consistent across different devices as web applications are not dependent on the underlying operating system of the devices they use.

ASHPense Manager was built with the following technologies:
### Front-end
