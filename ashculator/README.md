# ASHCULATOR
ASHCulator is a console-based application that performs simple arithmetic computations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo. This program does not implement any shell-based command.

## Process
The application executes in a loop. It presents the *ashculator,* **ashculate ?>** to the user for input. When provided with the correct input values, it prints the results **:) <value>** of the computation on the next line. It exits when the user enters **exit**.
